<h1> Understanding Customer Behavior on Shopee Malaysia Based on RFM Analysis (April - May 2023) </h1>

## 1. Project Overview
Shopee Malaysia is a leading e-commerce platform in Kuala Lumpur, catering to a diverse customer base. In the face of increasing competition and rapidly changing consumer behaviors, Shopee seeks to maintain its competitive edge by understanding its customers better and tailoring engagement strategies to their needs. This project leverages Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors and identify actionable insights for improving customer engagement, retention, and profitability.

Key Objectives:
- **Increasing Engagement for At-Risk Customers**: How can we increase engagement and retention for at-risk customers?
- **Focus on New Customer Conversion**: How can we convert new customers into loyal, long-term buyers?
- **Retention Strategies for Churned Customers**: What strategies can be implemented to reduce churn and win back churned customers?
- **Sustain Loyalty Growth**: How can we sustain the growth in the loyal customer segment?
- **Potential for Cross-Selling in the Other Group**: What opportunities for cross-selling and upselling exist within the "Other" group of customers?
- **Uncategorized Group**: How can we improve the classification of customers in the "Uncategorized" group and ensure more accurate segmentation?
