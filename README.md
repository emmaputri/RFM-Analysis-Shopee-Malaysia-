<h1> Understanding Customer Behavior on Shopee Malaysia Based on RFM Analysis (April - May 2023) </h1>

## 1. Project Overview
Shopee Malaysia is a leading e-commerce platform in Kuala Lumpur, catering to a diverse customer base. In the face of increasing competition and rapidly changing consumer behaviors, Shopee seeks to maintain its competitive edge by understanding its customers better and tailoring engagement strategies to their needs.

      - Insight: This group requires urgent re-engagement to prevent churn.

   - **Churned Group**: <br>
      - Modest growth in numbers. Primary categories are Health & Beauty, Home & Living, and Groceries & Pets, suggesting loss of interest or competing priorities.
      - Insight: Customers in this group are harder to win back but show potential for reactivation with targeted campaigns.

   - **Loyal Group**:<br>
      - Significant growth indicates strong retention efforts. Top categories are Women Clothes, Men Clothes, and Health & Beauty.
      - Insight: Loyalty strategies are working well; this group should be nurtured further to maintain their commitment.

   - **New Group**: <br>
      - Rapid growth from new acquisitions in May. Popular categories include Health & Beauty, Mobile & Accessories, and Men Clothes.
      - Insight: These customers are at the start of their lifecycle, providing a strong opportunity to establish loyalty early.

   - **Other and Uncategorized Groups**: <br>

      - Insight: These groups may benefit from further segmentation and analysis to identify tailored strategies.

2. Category Trends<br>
Health & Beauty consistently performs well across all segments, indicating it is a universal category.
Clothing (Men and Women) is a key interest for At-Risk, Loyal, and Other groups, highlighting its importance for fashion-focused customers.
Mobile & Accessories appeals to New and Other groups, reflecting interest in technology among newer customers.

3. Seasonal Trends<br>

Growth in Loyal and New groups implies successful marketing strategies to retain and acquire customers during this period.

4. Discount Strategy <br>
At-Risk and Churned Groups: Discounts may need optimization to re-engage and reactivate these groups effectively.
Loyal Group: Over-discounting could hurt margins; focus on exclusive, value-added benefits instead.

Other and Uncategorized Groups: High discount rates may reflect inefficiencies in resource allocation.
