## 5. Summary of Findings

### **5.1 Business Insights**
1. **Room Type Preferences:**  
   - Hotel rooms have the highest median price, followed by entire homes/apartments, private rooms, and shared rooms.  
   - Room type preferences significantly vary by neighborhood and review month, indicating demand shifts influenced by seasonality and location.  

2. **Price Dynamics Across Neighborhoods:**  
   - Significant differences in prices across neighborhoods suggest varying demand and customer value perceptions.  
   - Premium neighborhoods attract higher-paying customers, while others may cater to budget-conscious travelers.  

3. **Availability and Price Relationship:**  
   - An inverse relationship exists between availability and price, where properties with lower availability command higher prices, likely due to higher demand.  

4. **Seasonal Trends in Booking Patterns:**  
   - Customer behavior shows clear seasonal variations, with distinct room type preferences and price sensitivity during specific months.  

5. **Room Type Distribution by Neighborhood:**  
   - Certain neighborhoods exhibit a strong preference for specific room types, highlighting opportunities for targeted marketing and property optimization.
